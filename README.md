# ClusteringChallenge

#### -- Project Status: Ongoing

## Project Intro/Objective
A clustering open osurce challenge to separate a dataset consisting of three numeric features(A,B,C) into clusters


### Methods Used
* Data Exploration
* Machine Learning



### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
This project is a clustering problem. The data collected is over a chain of 100 stores, i will be developing K-means model to separate into different clusters. The features are :
  - A
  - B
  - C
  
I used Principal Component Analysis(PCA) feature extraction method to get siginificant features.
